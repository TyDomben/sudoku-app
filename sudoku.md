# Sudoku Rules and Logic

## Introduction

Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a 9x9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids that compose the grid (also called "boxes", "blocks", or "regions") contain all of the digits from 1 to 9.

## Basic Rules

1. Grid Layout: The Sudoku puzzle is played on a grid of 9x9 spaces.

2. Digits per Unit:
    - Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
    - Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
    - Each of the nine 3x3 subgrids must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.

3. Starting Clues: A standard Sudoku puzzle begins with some of the grid spaces already filled with digits. These are considered clues or fixed numbers that cannot be changed.

4. Solving the Puzzle: The puzzle is solved when all empty spaces are filled in with the correct digits according to the rules.

## Advanced Concepts

### Validity

A Sudoku puzzle is considered valid if it has at least one solution. A puzzle with no solution or more than one solution does not adhere to standard Sudoku rules.

### Difficulty Levels

The difficulty of a Sudoku puzzle can vary based on the number and placement of starting clues. Difficulty levels often range from Easy, Medium, Hard, to Expert, affecting the strategies needed to solve the puzzle.

### Solving Strategies

- Single Candidate: If a cell has only one possible digit that can be placed without violating Sudoku rules, that digit is placed in the cell.
- Single Position: If within a row, column, or block, a digit can only be placed in one position without breaking the rules, it must go there.
- Candidate Lines: If all potential places for a given number in a block lie along a single row or column, other occurrences of that number can be eliminated from that row or column outside of the block.
- Naked Pairs/Triples: If two or three cells in a row, column, or block contain only the same two or three numbers, those numbers can be removed as possibilities from other cells in the unit.
- Hidden Pairs/Triples: If a pair or triplet of numbers appears in exactly two or three cells within a unit but not exclusively, those cells can't contain any other numbers.
- X-Wing: A strategy that looks for rows or columns where a certain number appears as a possibility in exactly two places and forms a rectangle with another row or column with the same setup. This can sometimes allow elimination of those possibilities in other rows or columns.

### Puzzle Generation

Generating a Sudoku puzzle typically involves starting with a complete, valid solution and then strategically removing digits to create a puzzle that can be solved using logic. The number of digits removed and their positions influence the difficulty of the puzzle.

## Conclusion

Sudoku is a game of logic and pattern recognition. By applying the basic rules and advanced strategies, players can solve puzzles from simple to complex. Understanding these rules is crucial for anyone looking to develop a Sudoku app, as it lays the foundation for the game's logic and user interactions.
